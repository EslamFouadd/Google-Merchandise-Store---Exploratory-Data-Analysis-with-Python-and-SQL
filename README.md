# Google-Merchandise-Store---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python-and-SQL
BigQuery is a serverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse that works across clouds and scales with your data. Use built-in ML/AI and BI for insights at scale. 

The sample dataset contains Google Analytics 360 data (01/08/2016 - 01/08/2017) from the Google Merchandise Store, a real ecommerce store. The goal of this analysis is to address some key questions in marketing/web analytics from different angles such as channel performance in terms of traffic and revenue, individual page performance, and checkout process performance. I mainly used Python Client for BigQuery library along with pandas and matplotlib libraries to extract, query, and visualize data.
